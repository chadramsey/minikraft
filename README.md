### MiniKraft
MiniKraft is a modification of Minicraft, the Ludam Dare-submitted project 
authored by Markus Persson (aka Notch), written in the Kotlin programming language.

The original source code can be found [here](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=398).

### Progress
Since the intent of this project is to reconstruct Minicraft from the ground 
up, I will maintain the overall status of the project here:

- Part One: Implement Game() Part 1/3 - Complete
- Part Two: Implement Screen(), Spritesheet() - Complete
- Part Three: Implement InputHandler(), Menu() - Complete
- Part Four: Implement Implement TitleMenu(), Font(). Color() - Complete
- Part Five: Implement Implement Implement Game() Part 2/3 - Complete

#### Milestone One: Game menu with option selector is now rendered upon launch

- Part Six: Implement Implement Level(), Player() - In Progress

More information about this project as well as a detailed write up of my progress can be found [here]().

This project is not a representation of any future releases of Minicraft 
that may be published by its author.
