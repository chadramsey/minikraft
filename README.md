Minikraft
----------
This project is a modification of Minicraft, the Ludam Dare-submitted project 
written by Markus Persson (aka Notch), written in the Kotlin programming language.

up, I will maintain the overall status of the project here:

- Part Two: Implement Screen(), Spritesheet() - Complete
- Part Three: Implement InputHandler(), Menu() - Complete
- Part Four: Implement Implement TitleMenu(), Font(). Color() - Complete
